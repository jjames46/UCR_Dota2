The first thing to notice with the distribution of both character selection rate and character win rate is the skewness and orientation.
For character selection, this downward sloping trajectory makes sense, because over the course of the period, it is expected that every character,
at one point or another, will be selected. This is one of the weaknesses of my model, as it cannot account for the nuances of picks and counter-picks, etc.
However, the displayed data does fit with my expectation, as nearly all characters would have roughly 5-10% pick rate frequency, given
there are 10 players, and characters are not replaced.

The Histogram of the pickrate data also backs up the curvature, indicating that the discrete values appear as a normal distribution, minus
the few outliers of slightly stronger characters or characters that are favored in particular moments or roles.

This same thought process also fits with the character winrate data. One would expect that characters tend to win about as often as they lose,
at least that would be the ideal. The data is normally distributed over the 50% mark, which also confirms my expectation. At the point
in time where the data was collected, the game was relatively stable and balanced for each character.

The historgram of the winrate data displays the steep slope as the discrete winrates trend downward the higher the winrate goes. Additionally
reinforcing my expectation that most characters would fall below the 50% mark.
